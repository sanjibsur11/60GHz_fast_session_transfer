Installed the Xilinx ISE system design software

Step1: Compile and run the OFDM reference design of the WARPLab 
Step2: Checkout how to modify the MAC code in C (should not take more time)
Step3: Modify and generate the FPGA code of OFDM and replace with OOK 
modulation. Verify that the OOK modulation can be integrated with the MAC code 
to make it real-time processing.
Step4: Implementation for switching logic between one WARP board to another
Step5: Real-time channel estimation from multiple WARPs. We need at least two 
WARP board and we need to get data from multiple WARP boards together.
Step6: Final integration for the multiple WARP communication and 5 to 60 and 60
to 5 GHz switching
