This script blinks the red hex display of all nodes to ensure broadcast 
communication on the network.  

Hardware Setup:
  - Requires one or more WARP v3 nodes configured with the 802.11 Reference
      Design v0.81 or later.
  - PC NIC and ETH B on WARP v3 nodes connected to common gigbit Ethernet switch

Required Script Changes:
  - Set NETWORK to the IP address of your host PC NIC network (eg X.Y.Z.0 for IP X.Y.Z.W)

Description:
  This script will cause all nodes on each of the network to blink their hex 
displays.  If a node has not been initialized with an IP address (ie, it has 
just booted and and has not had its network configured via init_nodes()), then 
it will respond to all broadcast packets that are seen regardless of the 
network.  This is useful to test connectivity regardless of further network 
segmentation during the experiment.
