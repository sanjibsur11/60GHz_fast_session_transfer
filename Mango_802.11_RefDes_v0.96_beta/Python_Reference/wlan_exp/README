WLAN Experiment (wlan_exp)

  The WLAN Experiment framework provides the basic python communication 
structure for interacting with 802.11 nodes running on WARP hardware.  The 
The basic file structure:

  - node.py 
      - WLAN Experiment Node (WlanExpNode) is a sub-class of WARPNet Node and
        provides the base class for a single WARP node running a version of
        the 802.11 reference design (either Access Point (AP), or Station (STA))
  - node_*.py
      - Sub-class of WlanExpNode to implement features specific to roles
        of an 802.11 node.  Currently, the framework supports Access Points
        (AP) or Stations (STA). 
  - cmds.py
      - Python definitions for each command that is communicated between 
        the python node and the 802.11 node.
  - util.py
      - Top level utility functions used to interact with multiple nodes


Top Level Scripts:
  - None


Notes:
    The WLAN experiment framework builds on top of the 802.11 reference
design for WARP hardware:  https://warpproject.org/trac/wiki/802.11  to 
allow users to interact with nodes.

    It also utilize the warpnet framework for communicating with WARP 
nodes.  You can find the WARP documentation, binaries and toolchains on our 
website at http://warpproject.org/.
